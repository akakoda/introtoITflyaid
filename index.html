                    <p class="content-text">My Interest in Information Technology started when I was flying as an assistant flight instructor back home in Sri Lanka where there is no official aviation map to use when flying visually and thus there was no app or software for aerial navigation or route planning. What all pilots in Sri Lanka used for visual flying was the official road map published and provided by the Survey Department, which lack main geographical features that pilots use as visual navigation points when flying. These navigation points are important for a pilot to determine their true location, for route planning and to determine if they are on-course or how much they are off-course a particular route. What this map also lacked was the heights and boundaries of certain controlled airspaces. As a result, there has been many instances of pilots, especially student and non-familiar pilots, busting controlled airspace, that can lead to major air incident. I have personally had an experience during my initial days of flying in Sri Lanka where I could not determine my exact location due to unexpected bad weather and visibility, and in fact had to use google maps on my phone to help me find my location. This personal incident was what sparked my interest to develop a navigation app with the required aviation maps as a solution to this problem.

                    <p class="content-text">As a Sri Lankan we do not have many employment opportunities as pilots, while there is an oversupply of pilots for jobs available in the country. These two reasons make it very competitive to get employed as a pilot. The cadet pilot program of SriLankan Airlines now requires a degree in addition to the flying license requirements, as do many airlines globally. I chose RMIT as the university is well known in the field of aviation, especially in Sri Lanka. Many RMIT graduates have gained employment in some of the highly reputed airlines and manufactures globally. This is why I chose to come to RMIT.</p>
			<br>
As a final semester student, this degree has given me the opportunity to learn, and to certain degree practice, vital knowledge and skills that are required in the law, management and operations aspects of aviation as well important knowledge in technical and systems knowledge of aircraft. I chose to the subject, Intro To IT, as an elective to learn important basic IT skills that will aid me in developing an app that can be a solution to the problem discussed above.

                    <p class="content-text">Looking at the results above, gained through three different personality tests, we can see that I have scored high in extrovert, intuitive, prospecting and conscientiousness traits of personality, while scoring low on emotional stability and “feeling” traits of personality. I seem to also have scored high on intellect, agreeableness and assertiveness. This would mean that I can be a great leader for a team with capabilities of proper delegating and effective team working. The Myers-Briggs test results shown on the first image above, show that my ideal role as diplomat and strategy as people mastery. This supports my evaluation of the results. However, while my personality traits can have a positive impact on a team, the fact that I score high on intuitiveness means that, my ideal team would need a member that is counterintuitive.
