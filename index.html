                    <p class="content-text">My Interest in Information Technology started when I was flying as an assistant flight instructor back home in Sri Lanka where there is no official aviation map to use when flying visually and thus there was no app or software for aerial navigation or route planning. What all pilots in Sri Lanka used for visual flying was the official road map published and provided by the Survey Department, which lack main geographical features that pilots use as visual navigation points when flying. These navigation points are important for a pilot to determine their true location, for route planning and to determine if they are on-course or how much they are off-course a particular route. What this map also lacked was the heights and boundaries of certain controlled airspaces. As a result, there has been many instances of pilots, especially student and non-familiar pilots, busting controlled airspace, that can lead to major air incident. I have personally had an experience during my initial days of flying in Sri Lanka where I could not determine my exact location due to unexpected bad weather and visibility, and in fact had to use google maps on my phone to help me find my location. This personal incident was what sparked my interest to develop a navigation app with the required aviation maps as a solution to this problem.

                    <p class="content-text">As a Sri Lankan we do not have many employment opportunities as pilots, while there is an oversupply of pilots for jobs available in the country. These two reasons make it very competitive to get employed as a pilot. The cadet pilot program of SriLankan Airlines now requires a degree in addition to the flying license requirements, as do many airlines globally. I chose RMIT as the university is well known in the field of aviation, especially in Sri Lanka. Many RMIT graduates have gained employment in some of the highly reputed airlines and manufactures globally. This is why I chose to come to RMIT.</p>
			<br>
As a final semester student, this degree has given me the opportunity to learn, and to certain degree practice, vital knowledge and skills that are required in the law, management and operations aspects of aviation as well important knowledge in technical and systems knowledge of aircraft. I chose to the subject, Intro To IT, as an elective to learn important basic IT skills that will aid me in developing an app that can be a solution to the problem discussed above.

                    <p class="content-text">Looking at the results above, gained through three different personality tests, we can see that I have scored high in extrovert, intuitive, prospecting and conscientiousness traits of personality, while scoring low on emotional stability and “feeling” traits of personality. I seem to also have scored high on intellect, agreeableness and assertiveness. This would mean that I can be a great leader for a team with capabilities of proper delegating and effective team working. The Myers-Briggs test results shown on the first image above, show that my ideal role as diplomat and strategy as people mastery. This supports my evaluation of the results. However, while my personality traits can have a positive impact on a team, the fact that I score high on intuitiveness means that, my ideal team would need a member that is counterintuitive.

                <div class="col-lg-4 col-lg-offset-2">
			<p class="content-text"><b>Overview</b>
				<br>
The IT project idea that I have planned is the development of a mobile based navigation app with aviation tools and features, such as airport diagrams and, weight and balance calculators, that can be used in any android or apple based mobile device, including tablets. The initial target user base will be aircraft pilots in Sri Lanka that are primarily engaged in visual navigation flying. This will be a vital solution to a major issue that many pilots in Sri Lanka face as mentioned in a previous section of this report. 
<br>
				<br>
				<b>Motivation</b>
				<br>
Pilots in Sri Lanka that are engaged in visual flying face many issues during their day to day flying due to a lack of official visual navigation resources, such as an aviation map. Unlike in many other nations, pilots in Sri Lanka do not have access to a proper map for visual flying. A map suitable for aviation needs to at the least clearly depict the boundaries and heights of airspaces such as controlled airspaces, danger zones and restricted airspaces. The road map that the pilots use in Sri Lanka do not have the proper geographical features that are vital to visual flying. As a result of this, there are many incidents of pilot busting controlled or restricted airspaces and unfamiliar not being able to determine their location. This lack of navigation resources also means that there aren’t any proper mobile based navigation apps to aid pilots in their navigation flying. With 672 active flying license holders in Sri Lanka and 8 flying schools based in the country, a mobile based aviation app as such will come in great use to solve the problem described above.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Description</b>
				<br>
The app that I am planning on designing and developing will be in simple terms similar to Google Maps, Waze or any navigation app that is used for ground road-based navigation, however, with added aviation tools and features such as fuel calculators, airspace overlays and real time weather updates, with the possibility of overlaying the weather on the navigation map. Planned features are:
				<br>•	GPS based moving maps
				<br>
•	Route Planner
				<br>
•	Navigation aid Info (VOR, NDB)
				<br>
•	Landing Aid Info (ILS, Visual)
				<br>
•	Boundaries and heights of Controlled Airspace, Danger Zones and Restricted Airspaces
				<br>
•	Weight and balance calculator
				<br>
•	Fuel calculator
				<br>
•	Airport Diagrams
				<br>
•	Procedure plates (Approach and Departure)
				<br>
•	Airspace avoidance alerts
				<br>
•	Winds Forecaster
				<br>
•	Real time cloud cover and precipitation information
				<br>
•	Notices to Airmen (NOTAMS) Providing system
				<br>
•	Detailed Airport Information
				<br>
•	Emergency SOS alert system
				<br>
•	Traffic Avoidance System between aircraft using the same app
				<br>
•	In-app flight plan filing system
				<br>
•	Auto Pop-up of procedure plates and airport diagrams
				<br>
				<br>
The real time aircraft position will be shown on the airport diagrams and procedure plates through geo-referencing using the device’s inbuilt or externally connected GPS receiver. CAASL approved airways and visual navigation points will be pre-loaded on to the app to aid in easily planning routes throughout the island. The app will automatically detect the phase of flight and show the appropriate charts required for that phase of flight. The app will receive real time weather data sourced from windy.com and the Department of Meteorology – Sri Lanka to provide wind, cloud cover and precipitation information on the map itself, which can aid a pilot to avoid and predict any adverse weather conditions that can impact safe conducting of flight. In-app weight and balance, and fuel calculator can easily be accessed and be vital in the case of an emergency or diversion. Flight Plans can be easily filed directly from the app in a click of a button, saving a lot of time for the pilot. An airspace avoidance system will be inbuilt in the app to aurally and visually alert the pilot of any closing in controlled, restricted or danger airspace. An emergency SOS button will be inbuilt, which a pilot can use in a time of distress or emergency. This will alarm a ground-based relay unit that will in turn alert the appropriate authorities with all vital information about the aircraft, including location gained through the GPS.
The acquiring of real time date will require a cellular connection.

                <div class="col-lg-4">
			<p class="content-text">
				<b>Tools and Technologies</b>
				<br>
The base map for the app will be utilizing OpenStreetMap in the initial stage, until a dedicated map is developed. The end user will only require a IOS or Android based mobile or tablet with access to App Store in IOS or Google Play Store in Android. In order to make complete use of the app, the user will require a device with GPS location capability and a cellular connection. A device without GPS can be used, however, there will not be any moving maps available, unless an external GPS receiver is used. Similarly, a device without cellular can be used, however acquiring of real time data will not be possible, unless internet access has been granted to the device through other methods.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Skills Required</b>
				<br>
The skills required will be mainly for the design and development of the app. App development skills using the MIT App Inventor will be of high importance. In terms of hardware, a central server connecting all users will be vital, especially to implement a traffic avoidance system based on users using the app. In addition to the IT skills mentioned, skills for accurate map production will be required to develop a dedicated map for the project.
				<br>
				<br>
				<b>Outcome</b>
				<br>
The success of the project will mainly depend on how the project has solved the problems faced by pilots in Sri Lanka. I am in the understanding that the features and tools the app is planned to provide will be the solution. It will lead to a more efficient pre-flight planning and departure system for the pilots in the island. It will also hopefully lead to a safer sky above Sri Lanka, with reduced busting of controlled and restricted airspaces, and reduced likelihood of pilots losing their situational awareness. The added features in the app will contribute highly to safe conducting of flights and a greater situational awareness inside the aircraft. Flying can be stressful and these features can aid in reducing a pilot’s workload.
